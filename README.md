# graylog

Custom Logrus hook for sending structured logs to a Graylog server via GELF over TCP.

## üîß Purpose

This library is built for internal use within the [HydrAIDE Core](https://github.com/hydraide/core) and [HydrAIDE Server](https://github.com/hydraide/server) projects.  
Its goal is to provide **centralized, structured logging** with runtime control over log levels ‚Äî and resilience when Graylog is unavailable.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This library is designed for production-grade systems where logs must be shipped reliably and with context ‚Äî even if Graylog goes offline.
